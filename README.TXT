Ensure that you have Java Runtime on your machine
In order to run IslandHunter it is important to download:
(1) lib
(2) IslandHunter.jar
(3) user_manual.pdf (to be able to access the manual from the application)
Download the above contents of IslandHunter in the same directory (can name it IslandHunter)   

Note: (1) The "Results" directory contains a sample resultset after running IslandHunter for one genome file
      (2) The "Sample Mycobacteria Files" contains some sample .emb, .gbk and .fasta files
          In order to run IslandHunter: simply click on IslandHunter.jar

IslandHunter allows you to export selected GI regions to fast files. You may choose to export all GI regions to the same file or in separate files.
If the file contains annotations for coding sequences you may choose to export features that fall in each GI region in a separate file for each GI.

The files are created as follows, if you choose to the name “sample”:
(i) for all GIs in same file: sample.fasta
(ii) for each GI in separate file: sample_GI1.fasta, sample_GI2.fasta, etc..
(iii) If you decide to export the features, you will get sample_GI1Features.fasta, sample_GI2Features.fasta etc..

Note: I will upload an updated manual very soon.
